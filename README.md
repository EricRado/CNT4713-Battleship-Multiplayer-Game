5.    Add SSL or encryption in your communication [Extra credit either for one user or groups of 2. However, for groups of 2, the points will vary depending on the implementation of this] 
6.    Provide chat capabilities for the users connected in this application. 
7.    Do default application or approved application. 
8.    Create a youtube video demonstrating how it works 
9.    Create a read me file 
10.    Create a report (as you did in HW #1) 
[Default application]
Battleship Multi-Player Game
A) you should have the capabilities to create teams with players. For example, red, blue, yellow.
B) Each player gets a board. However, the team can coordinate via chat and also now information about their team member's board. You must provide a way to interact with the team.
C) Each team gets one turned but it is not synchronized. This means that a team of 3 may fired to different opposing teams (one shot at a time per player) but once the three players have fired, then they have to wait for them to received at least 3 fires from opposing teams (regardless of the size of the teams).
D) The team that destroy another team, wins a medal.
E) A team may quit, making the team that fired the most at them (succesfully) win the medal
F) If all teams decide to "FINISH", then medals goes to the team that destroyed the most
G) There needs to be feedback about what's going
H) There needs to be help menu to understand
I) Teams should be able to chat between their team members, all users regardless of team, or message to the other team. For example, if TEAM red sends a message to TEAM blue, all the blue (and red) will see the message....
